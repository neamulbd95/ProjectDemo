# ProjectDemo

This is a demo project given to me for recruitting. 
All the required services are completly created and tested. 
The Code is clean and easy to understand and swagger is also configured.
Repository Design Pattern, Layered architecture and Dependency injection has been used for maintaining the code.

Though Sadly, FrontEnd development is not complete due to time. Because of little expertise in frontend development, A error had occured, and It takes so many time to release.
